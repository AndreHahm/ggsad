  Guides an automated or manual git bisect session to find the exact commit that introduced a regression, running a test command at each step or walking the user through manual good/bad decisions. Use when hunting for the commit that broke a test, a feature, a build, or introduced a performance regression.

# Git Bisect Helper

Guide a git bisect session to find the commit that introduced a regression. $ARGUMENTS selects the mode: a good/bad commit pair for manual guided bisect, `--auto [test-command]` for automatic bisect, `--continue` to resume, or `--reset` to abort and clean up.

## Instructions

1. **Check current state**: run `git status`, `git branch --show-current`, and `git bisect log 2>/dev/null || echo "No active bisect session"` to see if a session is already in progress.
2. **Create a backup branch** before starting a new session (`git branch bisect-backup-<timestamp>`), so the original position is always recoverable.
3. Dispatch to the mode selected by `$ARGUMENTS`:

### Automatic bisect (`--auto [test-command]`)

1. `git bisect start`, then mark the given good/bad commits (or ask the user for them if not supplied).
2. At each bisect step, run the given test command via `Bash`.
3. Mark the commit `git bisect good` (exit code 0) or `git bisect bad` (non-zero).
4. Repeat until `git bisect` reports the first bad commit, then report it with its message, author, date, and changed files.

**Test-command scope**: `allowed-tools` only covers `npm`/`yarn`/`pnpm`/`pip`/`pytest`/`cargo`/`go`. If the user's test command needs a different tool (e.g. `bundle`, `mvn`, `gradle`), tell them explicitly that this skill can't run it under its current tool scope, and either ask them to run that step manually and report good/bad themselves, or fall back to Manual Guided Bisect.

### Manual guided bisect (`[good-commit] [bad-commit]`)

1. `git bisect start`, then `git bisect good <good-commit>` and `git bisect bad <bad-commit>`.
2. At each step, show the current commit (`git show --name-only --pretty="%H %s (%an, %ar)" HEAD`) and the changed files.
3. Ask the user via `AskUserQuestion` whether this commit is good or bad, then run `git bisect good`/`git bisect bad` accordingly.
4. Repeat until bisect reports the first bad commit.

### Continue (`--continue`)

Run `git bisect log` to show progress so far, then resume whichever mode (automatic/manual) the in-progress session appears to be using, based on what's already been marked.

### Reset (`--reset`)

Run `git bisect reset` to end the session and return to the original branch. Report the backup branch created in step 2 (if any) so the user can delete it once they've confirmed everything is fine.

## Reporting the result

Once the first bad commit is found, report: the commit hash, author, date, message, and changed files. Suggest recovery commands as text for the user to run themselves (this skill does not execute them): `git revert <bad-commit>` to undo it, or `git cherry-pick` to selectively keep the good parts of a mixed commit.

## Safety

- Always create a backup branch (step 2) before starting — a bisect session moves `HEAD` repeatedly via `git checkout`, and the backup is the recovery path if anything goes wrong.
- Never mark a commit good/bad without either a test result (automatic mode) or explicit user confirmation via `AskUserQuestion` (manual mode) — don't guess.
- If `git bisect` reports the range doesn't reproduce the regression (the given "bad" commit tests good, or vice versa), stop and tell the user rather than continuing with a broken range.
