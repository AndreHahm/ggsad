"""Deterministic secret redaction for analysis-kit report text.

Applied immediately before every skill's `Write` to `.claude/output/` --
strips or masks common secret-shaped patterns from already-drafted report
text. Never fails or blocks the write: matched values are replaced with
`[REDACTED]` in place (structure is preserved), and text with no matches
passes through unchanged. A missing/unreadable --input-file is a genuine
script error (distinct from "no secrets found") and returns exit code 1.

Pattern set is intentionally conservative and pattern-based, not a general
secret-scanning service -- it catches common, recognizable shapes
(Authorization/Bearer headers, .env-shaped KEY=value lines, known cloud key
prefixes) rather than attempting exhaustive coverage. A generic high-entropy
catch-all was deliberately not included -- see the comment above _PATTERNS
for why it did more harm than good in this specific plugin.

# A generic "long mixed-alphanumeric string" entropy heuristic was tried and

# (<scope-slug>-<timestamp>.md, e.g. "smoke-test-fixture-a-2026-08-05T05-00-00Z")
# and relative paths built from them are themselves long, hyphenated, and
# mixed-case -- indistinguishable from a real secret to a naive length/charset
# check. That heuristic redacted this plugin's own file-path citations, which
# are exactly the evidence these reports exist to preserve. The named patterns
# above (known header/prefix/env-var shapes) catch realistic report-context
# secrets with far lower false-positive risk; a true entropy scanner would need
# a real detection library, not a regex, and is out of scope here.
